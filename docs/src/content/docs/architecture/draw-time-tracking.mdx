Marco tracks when UI components are drawn on screen by hooking into platform-specific lifecycle methods. This allows measuring the time between component creation in JavaScript and when it becomes visible to users, helping identify performance bottlenecks.

## High-Level Architecture

The following diagram shows the core components involved in draw time tracking:

```d2 sketch pad=10 darkTheme=301
direction: down

js: {
  label: "JavaScript Component"
  shape: rectangle
}

native: {
  label: "Native View Creation"
  shape: rectangle
}

draw: {
  label: "Draw Time Detection"
  shape: rectangle
}

event: {
  label: "Event Dispatch"
  shape: rectangle
}

handler: {
  label: "JavaScript Handler"
  shape: rectangle
}

store: {
  label: "Performance Store"
  shape: rectangle
}

js -> native: "Wrapped with PerformanceTracker" {style.animated: true}
native -> draw: "Platform-specific rendering" {style.animated: true}
draw -> event: "Calculate render time" {style.animated: true}
event -> handler: "onTrackingEnd callback" {style.animated: true}
draw -> store: "Store metrics" {style.animated: true}

```

## Implementation Details

Marco uses different approaches for Android and iOS to detect when components are drawn on screen:

- **Android**: Uses the `onDraw()` method of the `PerformanceTrackerView` class
- **iOS**: Uses the `didMoveToWindow()` method when a view is added to the window hierarchy

Both implementations ensure minimal overhead by only tracking the first draw of components.

## Detailed Component Interaction

The following diagram shows the complete flow of draw time tracking, from JavaScript initialization to final event handling:

```d2 sketch darkTheme=301
direction: down

js: {
  label: "JavaScript Layer"
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f5f5f5"
}

js.init: {
  label: "Initialize PerformanceTracker"
  shape: rectangle
}

js.time: {
  label: "Capture timestamp"
  shape: rectangle
}

bridge: {
  label: "Native Bridge"
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#e6f7ff"
}

native: {
  label: "Native Layer"
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f0f5ff"
}

native.create: {
  label: "Create native view"
  shape: rectangle
}

native.draw: {
  label: "Platform draw detection"
  shape: rectangle
}

native.android: {
  label: "Android: onDraw()"
  shape: rectangle
}

native.ios: {
  label: "iOS: didMoveToWindow()"
  shape: rectangle
}

native.time: {
  label: "Capture draw time"
  shape: rectangle
}

native.calc: {
  label: "Calculate render time"
  shape: rectangle
}

storage: {
  label: "Storage Layer"
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#f9f0ff"
}

storage.store: {
  label: "Store metrics"
  shape: rectangle
}

storage.log: {
  label: "Optional logging"
  shape: rectangle
}

callback: {
  label: "Event Layer"
  shape: rectangle
  style.fill: "#fff7e6"
}

callback.dispatch: {
  label: "Dispatch event"
  shape: rectangle
}

callback.handle: {
  label: "Handle in JavaScript"
  shape: rectangle
}

js.init -> js.time
js.time -> bridge
bridge -> native.create
native.create -> native.draw
native.draw -> native.android
native.draw -> native.ios
native.android -> native.time
native.ios -> native.time
native.time -> native.calc
native.calc -> storage.store
native.calc -> storage.log
native.calc -> callback.dispatch
callback.dispatch -> callback.handle

```

  Both platforms follow a similar approach but use platform-specific lifecycle
  methods to detect when a component is drawn on screen.
