You can enable log persistence globally by configuring the `PerformanceTracker` to save logs to a file. This is useful for debugging or analyzing performance data offline.

## Example:

```tsx
import { PerformanceTracker } from 'react-native-performance-tracker';

PerformanceTracker.configure({
  persistToFile: true, // Logs will persist to a file for debugging purposes.
});
```

Once enabled, the logs will be saved to a file on the device or simulator.
