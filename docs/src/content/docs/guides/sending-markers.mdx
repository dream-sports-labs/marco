title: "Sending Custom Markers"
---

Custom performance markers can be sent at any point in your app to measure specific events or actions.

## Example:

```tsx
// Without metadata
PerformanceTracker.track('start_event', Date.now());

// With metadata
PerformanceTracker.track('start_event', Date.now(), { data: 'meta_data' });

```

##### Key Points:
- The `track` method accepts a `tag` and `time` as the minimum required parameters.
- You can also pass an optional `meta` object to include additional data.
