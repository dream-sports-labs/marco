You can retrieve all performance logs asynchronously using the `getLogs` method. This allows you to analyze performance data after it has been collected.

## Example:

```tsx
const logs = await PerformanceTracker.getLogs();
```

Logs are structured in a JSON format, and you can filter or analyze them based on your needs.
