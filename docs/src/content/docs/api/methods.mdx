Marco provides several methods to help you track custom events, reset all logs at any point, and retrieve performance logs for analysis.

### **`track`**

Custom performance markers can be sent at any point in app to measure specific events or actions.

For example:

```tsx
// Without metadata
PerformanceTracker.track('start_event', Date.now());

// With metadata
PerformanceTracker.track('start_event', Date.now(), { data: 'meta_data' });
```

##### Key Points:
- The `track` method accepts a `tag` and `time` as the required parameters.
- You can also pass an optional `meta` object to include additional data.

### **`getLogs`**

You can retrieve all performance logs asynchronously using the `getLogs` method. This allows you to analyze performance data after it has been collected.

For example:

```tsx
const logs = await PerformanceTracker.getLogs();
```

Logs are structured in a JSON format, and can be analyzed as needed.

### **`resetLogs`**

You can clear all performance logs at any time. This can be done through the `resetLogs` method.

For example:

```tsx
// Basic usage
PerformanceTracker.resetLogs();

// Clear logs and files (if persistToFile is true)
PerformanceTracker.resetLogs({ clearFiles: true });
```

This will reset the logs and optionally clear the persisted log files.
