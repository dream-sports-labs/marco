# react-native-performance-tracker ðŸ“Š

A powerful React Native library to track and log performance metrics for screens and components. It leverages the new architecture with **TurboModules** and **Fabric** for improved efficiency. The library provides insights into render times, draw times, and helps identify performance bottlenecks in your app.

## âœ¨ Features
- **Track Render Times**: Measure the time taken to render screens and components.
- **Track Draw Times**: Capture the exact time when content is fully painted on the screen.
- **Custom Markers**: Send custom timestamps for events.
- **Logs Management**: Retrieve and reset logs as needed.
- **Supports New Architecture**: Fully compatible with TurboModules and Fabric.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Seamlessly works across iOS and Android, ensuring consistent performance tracking on both platforms.
- **Performance Visualization Dashboard**: Interactive dashboard to visualize logs, analyze performance metrics, and generate detailed reports.
- **Data Retrieval**: Automated scripts to fetch and structure performance logs based on the selected platform.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

```bash
yarn add react-native-performance-tracker
cd ios && pod install
```

## ðŸš€ Usage Example

### 1. **Track Screen Rendering with the Component**
Wrap your screen or component with PerformanceTracker to automatically capture render and draw times:

```tsx
import { PerformanceTracker } from 'react-native-performance-tracker';

const MyScreen = () => {
  return (
    <PerformanceTracker
      tagName="MyScreen"
      startMarker="screen_load_start"
      isEnabled={true}
      onDrawEnd={(event) => {
        console.log('Draw Time:', event.nativeEvent.drawTime);
        console.log('Render Time:', event.nativeEvent.renderTime);
        console.log('Diff Time:', event.nativeEvent.diffTime); 
        // Logs the time difference between the start marker and draw time. 
        // If no start marker is provided, the value will be null.
      }}
    >
      {/* Your screen content goes here */}
    </PerformanceTracker>
  );
};

```

### 2. **Send Custom Markers**

Send custom performance markers at any point in your app:

```tsx
PerformanceTracker.track('start_event', Date.now());
```

### 3. **Retrieve Logs**
Retrieve performance logs asynchronously:

```tsx
const logs = await PerformanceTracker.getLogs();
console.log('Performance Logs:', logs);
```

### 4. **Reset Logs**
Clear all performance logs:

```tsx
PerformanceTracker.resetLogs();
```

### 5. **Enable Performance Log Persistence**
Enable performance log persistence globally by setting the configuration during the initialization of the PerformanceTracker.

```tsx
import { PerformanceTracker } from 'react-native-performance-tracker';

PerformanceTracker.init({
  persistToFile: true, // Logs will persist to a file for debugging purposes.
});
```

### 6. **Log File Paths**

When `persistToFile` is enabled, the logs will be saved to a file for later retrieval. The file paths differ between **Android** and **iOS**:

#### Android
The benchmark logs are saved to the following path on the device:

```bash
/sdcard/Documents/PerformanceTracker/log.txt
```
#### iOS

The benchmark logs are saved to the following path on the iOS device or simulator:

```bash
Documents/PerformanceTracker/log.txt
```

## How to Retrieve Data?

To retrieve performance data from your app, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command:

  ```bash
  npx generate:report
  ```
2. Select the platform:

 Choose **Android** or **iOS** based on your preference.
For **iOS**, provide the package name when prompted. This is required to access the data folder for the app.

3. The script will create a folder named `generated-perf-reports` at the root of the directory where this script is run. Ensure you execute this command at the project root.

4. Inside the `generated-perf-reports` folder, a `log.json` file will be created containing the performance data.

## ðŸ“Š Visualisation

To visualize the retrieved performance data:

1. Run the visualization script:

  ```bash
  npx visualize:report
  ```

2. Open the following URL in your browser to access the server and visualize the data:

  - http://localhost:8080

## How to Access the Visualization Dashboard?

The visualization dashboard allows you to analyze and interpret performance data effectively. Here's how to use it:

1. Navigate to the HTML server URL: http://localhost:8080.

2. Use the interface to:

- **Select Start and End Markers**: Define the range of data you wish to analyze.
- Click the **Visualize** button.

3. The dashboard will display:

- Mean, standard deviation, and error rate.
- A graph visualizing performance trends.
- A table showing raw data in tabular format for detailed insights.
